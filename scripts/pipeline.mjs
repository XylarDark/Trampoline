/**
 * The stage runner shared by `verify.mjs` and `preflight.mjs`.
 *
 * Both pipelines make the same distinction, so it lives in one place: an exit code says "nothing
 * threw", while evidence says "the suite ran 107 tests and all passed". A stage that exits zero
 * without producing its expected output is reported as `inconclusive`, never as a pass.
 *
 * A stage may declare an `available()` predicate for a tool that might not be installed. When it
 * returns false the stage is `not run`, which is distinct from both a pass and a failure: the
 * check did not happen, and nothing about its subject was demonstrated.
