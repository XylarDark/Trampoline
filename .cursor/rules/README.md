# Cursor rules

Every rule here is **glob-scoped**: it enters the context window only when the agent touches a
matching file. Nothing in this directory is always applied, and that is deliberate.

Always-loaded context belongs in one of two other places:

- **[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md)** (repository root) — facts about Trampoline that are true on
  every turn: the stack, the commands, the load-bearing evidence rules, the legal constraints.
  Cursor loads it automatically, as do Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI, so one file serves every
  tool.
- **`.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`** — procedural knowledge. A skill costs only its `description`
  until that description matches the task, then the agent reads the body.

## Why nothing here is always-applied

This directory used to carry 14 always-applied rules totalling 1,153 lines — roughly 12,000–15,000
tokens billed on every single turn, including turns with nothing to do with their content. Long
context evaluations consistently find that irrelevant always-loaded context *lowers* accuracy, so
the cost was not merely wasted, it was harmful.

That content now lives in `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/skills/`. `npm run doctor` reports the
always-apply budget, so re-adding one is a visible decision rather than a quiet regression.

Where the retired rules went:

| Was | Now |
| --- | --- |
| `00-core-principles` | `AGENTS.md`, working agreements |
| `01-code-quality` | `.agents/skills/code-structure` |
| `02-security` | `.agents/skills/secure-coding` |
| `03-testing` | `.agents/skills/testing-standards` |
| `04-git-workflow` | `AGENTS.md`, conventions |
| `05-error-handling` | `.agents/skills/defensive-programming` |
| `06-documentation`, `19-docs-directory-structure` | `.agents/skills/documentation` |
| `07-ai-agent-behavior` | `.agents/skills/agent-workflow` |
| `08-project-context` | `AGENTS.md` — stack, layout, load-bearing rules, legal constraints |
| `16-feature-debug-instrumentation` | `.agents/skills/debug-instrumentation` |
| `17-plan-first` | `.agents/skills/plan-first` |
| `18-content-and-data-pipelines` | `.agents/skills/data-pipeline-safety` |
| `automation-standards` | `.agents/skills/automation-standards` |

## The rules

| Rule | Applies to |
| --- | --- |
| `10-typescript.mdc` | `**/*.ts`, `**/*.tsx` |
| `13-markdown.mdc` | `**/*.md` |
| `14-json-yaml.mdc` | `**/*.json`, `**/*.yaml`, `**/*.yml` |
| `15-shell-scripts.mdc` | `**/*.sh`, `**/*.ps1`, `**/*.bat` |
| `20-frontend-frameworks.mdc` | `**/components/**`, `**/pages/**`, `**/app/**` |

The leading numbers group related rules for humans. Cursor ignores them, and it ignores any
frontmatter key outside `description`, `globs`, and `alwaysApply`.

## File format

```yaml
---
description: What this rule covers, shown in the rule picker
globs: '**/*.ts'
alwaysApply: false
---
```

Write `globs`, plural. A singular `glob:` key is silently ignored, which produces a rule that looks
scoped but never loads.

## Keeping these in sync with the template

These rules come from [DevEnvTemplate](https://github.com/XylarDark/DevEnvTemplate), embedded at
`.devenv/`. To pull newer versions:

```powershell
npm run doctor -- --integrate-cursor-rules
```

Existing files are never overwritten, so local edits survive. Compare against
`.devenv/.cursor/rules/` if you want the newer version of a rule you have changed.
