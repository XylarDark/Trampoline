/**
 * Fail-closed secret scanner for agent hooks.
 *
 * Wired to `beforeReadFile` and `beforeShellExecution` in `.cursor/hooks.json`. Cursor imports
 * Claude Code's hook format, so the same script serves both tools.
 *
 * This is the cheapest real mitigation for agent-driven credential exfiltration: an agent that
 * reads a `.env` and then curls it somewhere is the documented attack, and blocking the read is
 * more reliable than hoping the model declines.
 *
 * Protocol (see https://cursor.com/docs/hooks):
 *   stdin  - JSON payload including `hook_event_name` and the event's own fields.
 *   stdout - `{"permission": "allow" | "deny" | "ask", "user_message": ..., "agent_message": ...}`
 *            The message keys are snake_case; camelCase variants are silently discarded.
 *
 * Three implementation constraints, all learned the hard way. With `failClosed` set, each of
 * these failure modes blocks every operation in the editor, so they matter more than usual:
 *
 * 1. Write the decision with `fs.writeSync(1, ...)`, not `process.stdout.write`. On a Windows
 *    pipe the latter is asynchronous and its callback fires when the data is queued rather than
 *    delivered, so the payload can be lost whether you exit from the callback or let the process
 *    end on its own. The audit log recorded complete writes on invocations Cursor reported as
 *    returning no output. `writeSync` blocks until the OS accepts the bytes.
 *
 * 2. Destroy stdin before exiting. Left open, the process lingers until Cursor kills it at the
 *    configured timeout.
 *
 * 3. Cursor prefixes the payload with a UTF-8 BOM, which `JSON.parse` rejects.
 *
 * Cursor fails *open* on crash, timeout, or unparsable output, so `failClosed: true` in
 * `.cursor/hooks.json` is what actually closes that hole.
