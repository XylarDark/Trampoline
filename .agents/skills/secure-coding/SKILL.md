# Secure coding

Assume every input is hostile and every secret will leak if it is checked in. Apply these
checks while writing the code, not in a separate audit pass — a review that defers them all to
the end finds them when they are expensive, and usually does not find them at all.

One exception, and it is narrow: the deploy-time controls in [The hardening
pass](#the-hardening-pass) cannot be applied while writing code, because they are properties of
a running deployment rather than of a file. Everything above that section stays inline and
mandatory. Nothing moves out of it into the pass.

## OWASP Top 10 checks

**Injection**

- Never concatenate user input into queries, shell commands, or file paths.
- Use parameterized queries and prepared statements.
- Validate input types and formats before the value reaches a query or command.

**Authentication and sessions**

- Never store passwords in plain text; use a purpose-built password hash.
- Use random, long, rotated session tokens.
- Implement real logout (invalidate the session server-side).
- Never put session IDs in URLs.

**Sensitive data exposure**

- Never commit secrets. See [Secrets](#secrets).
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit; use HTTPS for every external connection.
- Never log secrets, tokens, or personal data.

**XML external entities (XXE)**

- Disable external entity processing in any XML parser.
- Prefer JSON or YAML over XML; validate schemas strictly when XML is required.

**Broken access control**

- Verify authorization on every request, server-side.
- Never trust client-side validation alone.
- Apply least privilege to users, tokens, and service accounts.

**Security misconfiguration**

- Remove default credentials and disable unused features.
- Keep dependencies current.
- Set security headers (CSP, HSTS) on anything served over HTTP.

**Cross-site scripting (XSS)**

- Escape output for its destination context (HTML, JavaScript, SQL).
- Prefer the framework's built-in escaping over hand-rolled sanitizers.
- Add a Content Security Policy.

**Insecure deserialization**

- Never deserialize untrusted data.
- Validate the structure of anything deserialized.
- Prefer safe formats (JSON over `pickle`).

**Known-vulnerable components**

- Update dependencies regularly and scan them in CI (`npm audit` for Node projects).
- Monitor advisories for anything pinned.
- Remove unused dependencies rather than leaving them installed.

**Logging and monitoring**

- Log security events: failed logins, access denials, privilege changes.
- Never log sensitive values.
- Alert on suspicious patterns instead of relying on manual log reading.

## Secrets

Never commit API keys, passwords, tokens, private keys, database credentials, or OAuth
secrets.

- Store secrets in `.env` files that are gitignored.
- Commit a `.env.example` with placeholder values and a comment per variable.
- Validate required environment variables on startup and fail fast when one is missing.
- Use separate secrets per environment (dev, staging, prod) and rotate them on a schedule.
- Use a managed secret store in production (AWS Secrets Manager or equivalent) rather than
  shipping `.env` files to servers.

If a tool blocks editing `.env.example` because it is globally ignored, generate the file
from a script instead of forcing the editor past the ignore rule.

## Environment file templates

Common variants: `.env.example` (default), `.env.local.example` (Next.js),
`.env.development.example`, `.env.production.example`.

In Next.js projects, document every `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variable and remember those values are
shipped to the browser — never put a secret behind that prefix.

```bash
# Environment variables for <project>
# Copy to .env.local and fill in your values. Never commit the filled-in file.

# API configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=

# Development settings
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Checklist

- [ ] No secrets in code, config, or committed history
- [ ] All external input validated and sanitized at the boundary
- [ ] Authorization verified server-side for every request
- [ ] Dependencies scanned for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Error messages leak no internal detail (paths, stack traces, SQL)
- [ ] HTTPS for all external connections
- [ ] Security headers configured

## The hardening pass

> **Localize on copy.** The commands and the specifics below are Trampoline's. Another project
> runs its own equivalent gate, or none; the substance of the pass is portable, the details are
> not.

Run once, when features and taste are locked and the product is about to be deployed for the
first time — or redeployed after a change large enough that its shape moved. It is not a
recurring chore, and it is not a substitute for the inline checks above: it covers only what
writing code correctly cannot reach.

Start with `npm run preflight`. It runs the verify pipeline, a full `next build`, the dependency
audit, registry signatures, a `gitleaks` scan, and `npm run check:placeholders`, and it writes
`.devenv/preflight-report.json`. Two of those deserve naming: the audit is **blocking** here
while the `audit` job in CI runs it `continue-on-error`, and a missing `gitleaks` is reported as
**not run** rather than passed, which blocks the gate exactly as a failure does.

Then work the residue by hand, because no command in this repository can see any of it.

**The legal preconditions come first.** `docs/research/legal-and-privacy.md` lists 13 things that
must be true before this stores one real person's real health-derived data. Seven are legal or
organizational, one needs a written opinion from an Ontario privacy and employment lawyer, and no
change to this repository satisfies any of them. A green preflight says nothing about that list.

**Deploy-time configuration.** Production secrets separate from every other environment, on a
rotation schedule, in the hosting platform's secret store rather than a `.env` file copied to a
server. The [Secrets](#secrets) section states the rule; the pass is when someone confirms it is
true of the actual deployment.

**Placeholder credentials that ship.** `.env.example` carries `AUTH_SECRET=replace-me`, and no
startup check reads it, so a deployment that never replaced it would authenticate sessions with a
value published in this repository. `npm run check:placeholders` compares the template against
every local environment file; run it against the environment the deployment actually uses, since
it can only see the files in this tree.

**Fail-fast validation of required environment variables.** Nothing here does this yet. `auth.ts`
falls back to a JSON transport when `AUTH_EMAIL_SERVER` is empty, which is right for local
development and wrong in production, where a missing mail server should stop the process rather
than silently swallow every sign-in link.

**The CSP, as served.** `next.config.ts` sets `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` and says in a
comment to move to the nonce-based policy before this handles real client data. That is a gate
item. Verify CSP and HSTS against a response from the running deployment, not against the config:
middleware order, a proxy, or a CDN can drop a header that the file plainly sets.

**The sign-off list.** `preflight` prints the controls no repository check can observe, and
records them in its report as requiring sign-off rather than passed. Someone accountable ticks
them, or the release goes out with them open and that is a decision rather than an oversight.
